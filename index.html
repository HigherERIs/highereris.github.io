<h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>I am currently a refugee seeker in Serbia. I think Serbia is shit. It's full of words only and no action. This is a country of show. Showman. They show brand/outer appearances, and no real action. I hate this country. I think it's a weak country, I think I can take over this place. </p>
<p>I’m going to take over Serbia. I need quantum etc. I’ll post projects here. I need artificial life.</p>
  <h2>Things I think I'll need</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Maths</li>
    <li>Math Engineering</li>
    <li>Physics</li>
    <li>Computer Science</li>
    <li>AI</li>
    <li>Quantum AI</li>
    <li>Bioquantum Computers</li>
    <li>Artificial Life</li>
    <li>Robots</li>
    <li>Molecular assemblers/universal constructors</li>
    <li>automated maths</li>
    <li>hacking/reverse engineering etc. hacking is very important</li>
    <li>mobile/apps/bci/merging with tech etc. </li>
    <li>robots</li>
    <li>p2p/my own internet/eris net etc. </li>
    <li>slime mold</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It is just essential to have a much stronger wifi (hack the routers, spoofing/hardware or get satelite dishes on abandoned buildings/p2p etc.). And for me to understand hacking/reverse engineering, how computers work/wifi/bottom up computing/computers/bioquantum computers/maths/physics/cs/ai etc. there are so many things that I'm lacking at. nand to tetris, nand to jjsploit, nand to synapsex etc. Robots/mobile app programming etc. I need to build robots/exosuits etc. </p>
